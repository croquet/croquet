# Croquet ðŸ¦©

*Croquet lets you build real-time multiuser apps without writing server-side code. Unlike traditional client/server architectures, the multiplayer code is executed on each client in a synchronized virtual machine, rather than on a server.*

Croquet is available as a JavaScript library that synchronizes Croquet apps using Multisynq's global DePIN network. Additionally, the reflector server keeping VMs in sync is available as a node.js package.
