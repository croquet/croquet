# What is Croquet?

_Croquet_ is a synchronization system for multiuser digital experiences. It allows multiple users to work or play together within a single shared distributed environment, and it guarantees that this distributed environment will remain bit-identical for every user.

This synchronization using the _Teatime_ protocol is largely invisible to the developer. Creating a _Croquet_ application does not require the programmer to write separate client and server code. Applications are developed as though they are local, single-user experiences, and the _Croquet_ library takes care of the rest.
