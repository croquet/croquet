This is an example of how a Croquet app can call on the services of a rich, independently developed JavaScript library - in this case, <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> for 3D rendering through WebGL. The example expands into the third dimension the kind of animation shown in Tutorial 2: balls bounce off the (invisible) walls of a container, and off a sphere that's embedded in the far wall of the container. Dragging the sphere moves it, constrained to the container bounds.  Clicking on the sphere resets the balls' positions to the sphere's center.

## **Try it out!**
As usual, clicking the QR code will launch a new Codepen instance of this session. In any instance, try clicking on or dragging the central sphere.

_1 July 2019: This tutorial will be fleshed out in the coming days._
