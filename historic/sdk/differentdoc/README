differentdoc is a new document generator (but it is not newdocs) that uses jsdoc.

It accommodates multiple projects. Each project is a subdirectory. You need to install jsdoc, and you better have npm-watch.  Run `npm install` in this directory.

To make a new project, make a directory, and copy jsdoc.json and package.json from an existing project. In jsdoc.json, replace the "include" array with the .js and .md files that has your documentation.  opts.tutorials should point to a directory that has a series of .md files.  destination should be `../build/<your project>`.  (If your tutorial has additional files, templates.staticFiles.include needs to have them.  Change docdash.meta to change the title.

You don't actually have to run `npm install` in the project subdirectory, but npm-watch helps you view the result of your edit faster. Change the list in `watch.build.patterns`, and then run `npm run watch` in a shell. Then editing a file listed in patterns would trigger re-generation of the html file tree in to the `build` directory of the subdirectory . (You'd still have to reload.)

`build.sh` is called to make the directory that contains all projects. Add index.html in this directory is copied over to build as the entry point for those project documents.  (As of now, it is called from `deploy.sh`, which in turn called from `deploy.sh` of the parent directory.)
