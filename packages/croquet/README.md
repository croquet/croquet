# Croquet

Croquet enables completely client-side multi-user webapps:

* can be hosted as a **static website**
* **no server-side** code needed
* **no networking** code needed
* independent of UI framework

Synchronization happens via Croquet's global reflector fleet:

* clients execute in sync: a shared model
* user input via pub/sub
* synchronized computation via shared clock even without event publishing

This lets you build richer experiences than ever possible before:

* multiplayer Games
* multiuser  AR / VR / WebXR
* shared Simulations

... but most importantly it's **much simpler** to build shared webapps:

**Get Started ...**

* get a free developer key at [croquet.io/keys](https://croquet.io/keys/)
* follow the documentation at [croquet.io/docs](https://croquet.io/docs/croquet/)

**... building Instantaneous Shared Experiences!**
