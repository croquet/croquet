# Croquet

**Croquet enables you to build real-time multiuser applications without writing server-side code.** Unlike traditional client/server architectures, the multiplayer logic executes on each client in a synchronized virtual machine, rather than on a centralized server.

*Croquet is available as a JavaScript library that synchronizes applications using Multisynq's global DePIN network.*

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

- üöÄ **Deploy as static websites** - No server infrastructure needed
- üîß **No server-side code** - Focus purely on your application logic  
- üåê **No networking code** - Automatic synchronization handled for you
- üéØ **Framework independent** - Works with React, Vue, vanilla JS, and more

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Get Your API Key
Get a free API key from [multisynq.io](https://multisynq.io/coder)  
*(You can also run your own server, but the global Multisynq network is used by default)*

### 2. Install Croquet

**Via npm:**
```bash
npm install @croquet/croquet
```

**Via CDN (pre-bundled):**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@croquet/croquet@2.0.0/pub/croquet.min.js"></script>
```

**Via ES modules:**
```javascript
import * as Croquet from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@croquet/croquet@2.0.0/pub/croquet.esm.js";
```

### 3. Structure Your Application

Organize your app into two parts:
- **Synchronized part**: Subclass `Croquet.Model` - shared state and logic
- **Local part**: Subclass `Croquet.View` - user interface and local interactions

### 4. Join a Session

Use `Croquet.Session.join()` with your API key to connect users.

**That's it!** No server deployment needed - just HTML and JavaScript.

## üéØ The Prime Directive

**Your Croquet Model must be completely self-contained.**

### Model Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Deterministic**: Must produce identical results on all clients
- ‚úÖ **Serializable**: Store state in object-oriented style (no functions)
- ‚úÖ **Event-driven**: Interact with outside world only via view-published events
- ‚ùå **No global state**: Cannot read from global variables
- ‚ùå **No async code**: Cannot use Promises, async/await, setTimeout, etc.

### View Flexibility

The view layer has no restrictions - use any programming style, framework, or async patterns you prefer.

### Why These Rules?

These constraints ensure that all clients maintain identical state, enabling Croquet's unique architecture where the "server" logic runs identically on every client.

## üåê Infrastructure & Security

### Global Network
By default, Croquet runs on the [Multisynq DePIN network](https://multisynq.io), which automatically selects a server close to the first user in each session for optimal performance.

### Self-Hosting
You can [run your own reflector](https://github.com/croquet/croquet/tree/main/packages/reflector), though you won't benefit from global deployment.

### Privacy & Security
- **End-to-end encryption**: All communication encrypted by random session password
- **Zero server processing**: Application code and data only processed on clients  
- **Server-blind**: Servers never decrypt application data
- **Maximum privacy**: One of the most private real-time multiplayer solutions available
